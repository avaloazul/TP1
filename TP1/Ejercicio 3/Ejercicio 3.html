<p><br>
  Tell me what you really like </br>
  <br>Baby I can take my time </br>
  <br>We don't ever have to fight </br>
  <br>Just take it step-by-step  </br>
  <br>I can see it in your eyes </br>
  <br>Cause they never tell me lies </br>
  <br>I can feel that body shake </br>
  <br>And the heat between your legs </br>
</p>
<p>You've been scared of love, and what it did to you, you don't have to run I know what you've been through, just a simple touch and it can set you free, we don't have to rush when you're alone with me.
</p>
